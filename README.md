=======
This is a repository for the Human Face of Big Data project from DCIC, iSchool, UMD.


### Folder Structure

#### doc
Any technical documents that students learned and implmented can be placed here as markdown (.md) files. Markdown syntax are avaible at https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

#### GIS
QGIS files and shape files for target cities are available here. Some big files need to be downloaded from the UMD Box for the project. 

#### html
Any web-related materials such as PHP, Javascript, and SQL files are here. This folder will be directly used on the server in the future.

#### vm
Vagrant and Ansible are a good solution to maintain each member's local development environment consistent. It is not required to use Vagrant, but it is highly recommended in the development process. Configuration files and scripts are available in this folder.

- For Linux and Mac users: use `vm/mac/` for `vagrant up`
- For Windows users: use `vm/windows/` for `vagrant up`

##### As of November 2018, there have been updates on the Vagrant, Ansible, and Virtualbox versions based on OS updates: `Vagrant 2.2`, `Ansible 2.7`, and `VirtualBox 5.2` 

### Resources and Tools
Data files and resources are not publically available, but will be open to project participants. If you need access to any of the resources, contact Myeong Lee at myeong@umd.edu.

#### Raw Data and Supporting Document
Raw data, scanned documents, and supporting PPT files are available at UMD Box and Dropbox. 

#### Google Doc Folder
We have a Google doc folder to share online documents. A kick-off meeting slide and a design document are available at the Google Doc folder.
