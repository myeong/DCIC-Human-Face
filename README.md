Human Face of Big Data
=======
This is a repository for the Human Face of Big Data project from DCIC, iSchool, UMD.


### Folder Structure

#### doc
Any technical documents that students learned and implmented can be placed here as markdown (.md) files. Markdown syntax are avaible at https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

#### GIS
QGIS files and shape files for target cities are available here. Some big files need to be downloaded from the UMD Box that will be notified separately. 

#### html
Any web-related materials such as PHP, Javascript, and SQL files are here. This folder will be directly used on the server in the future.

#### vm
Vagrant and Ansible are a good solution to maintain each member's local development environment consistent. It is not required to use Vagrant, but it is highly recommended in the development process. Configuration files and scripts will be placed here in the future.

#### Raw Data and Supporting Document
